TO-DOS
------------------
-figure out how to store to individual account
-add a dialog to confirm idea delete
-fix up styling: community buttons, background video, google fonts, transition animations if possible, change the colors, set a max width on cards, probably ditch the accordian

-social share: if it would be easy to share a single idea page via widget, do that. if not, mainpage

-create a signup success modal and redirect to add page
-messaging for first visit
